##Filtering Columns and Rows

With SQl, you can filter Coulmns and Rows by using SELECT and WHERE. Lets look at an example using the Lahman database. We should first load that database, along with the package sqldf. 

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
```

Suppose now I would like to see the homerun totals for the 1927 Yankees. I could write the following query: 

```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID,yearID,teamID,HR FROM Batting
WHERE teamID='NYA' and yearID=1927"
sqldf(query)
```
